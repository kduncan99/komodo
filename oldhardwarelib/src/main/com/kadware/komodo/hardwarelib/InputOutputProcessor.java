/**
 * Class which models an IO Processor node.
 * An IO is presented to an IO processor in one of two ways:
 *      1) A UPI is sent to the IOP with the absolute address of an IO packet.
 *      2) startIO() is invoked, with the absolute address of an IO packet as a parameter.
 * In either case, the IO is routed directly to the channel module object in question.
 * If the channel module index is wrong, the IO is rejected immediately.
 * The channel module may also reject the IO immediately, for any number of reasons including a bad device number.
 * If the IO can be scheduled, it is scheduled on the channel module's IO queue, and the status of the given
 * channel program (see below) is set to in-progress.
 * At some point, the channel module picks up the IO and does various things with it (hopefully sending it on
 * to the targeted device).
 * When the IO is complete, the device notifies the channel module which then notifies the IOP.
 * The IOP will then either SEND to the processor complex resulting in one IP getting a UPI NORMAL interrupt,
 * or it will set up the interrupt directly on an IP.
 * When the IP interrupt is scheduled, the SEND is ACK'd, and the IOP forgets the IO.
