/**
 * Represents a particular machine interrupt class
 * The Breakpoint interrupt occurs if the H-bit of the Breakpoint Register is clear,
 * and one of the following conditions is met:
 *      The Real or Absolute Address contained in the Breakpoint Register is equal to the
 *          Real or Absolute Address of the current instruction, and the breakpoint P-bit is set.
 *      The Real or Absolute Address contained in the Breakpoint Register is equal to a Real or Absolute operand address and
 *          The operation is a read and the breakpoint R-bit is set or
 *          The operation is a write and the breakpoint W-bit is set.
 * A Breakpoint interrupt may be caused without an actual occurrence of a match when a
 * User Return instruction is executed with the Breakpoint Pending bit set in the Indicator/Key Register.
