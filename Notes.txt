-- InProgress
IP: address space management instructions (and unit tests)
  LBU, LBE, LBUD, LBED, SBUD, SBED, *SBU, LBN, TRA, TRARS, TVA, *DABT

-- TODO BUGS
SLJ instruction - U < 0200 is GRS, U+1 is always storage (we don't do that)
When shifting left for upper limit, we should shift 1's in, right?

-- TODO implemeent
* baselib
some new instructions

* hardwarelib
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)
IP: do active base table thing
IP,IOP: UPI send/ack mechanism for IOs
IP: operations control instructions (and unit tests)
  SEND
  ACK
MSP: add support for banks dynamically allocated from native system
IP: IPC instruction for dynamic bank allocation
IP: implement standard bank switching logic
IP: interrupt processing, use standard bank switching logic
IP: IPC instruction for console communication
SCP: For starting/monitoring/stopping system, and for console communication
IOP: rework IOP, CHMOD, and downstream - lose CU's maybe
Rewrite disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO
All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private
IP: UNLK instruction

* minalib
unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
need to put partial-words into the dictionary - and should we allow these as expressions in j-field?
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff
pick up the rest of the unit tests we need to do but haven't yet
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
float values - firm this up (how do we support it)
data generation - floats
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
make sure we don't propagate flagged attribute in any of the operators
support user-defined functions
allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)
functions

  $NODE (an empty node - this is maybe a built-in value, not a function?)
directives
  $END directive on top-level code (do we require it?)
  $EQUF
  $USE (implicit base register)
  $INSERT (maybe)
  $BASE (maybe)
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF

  $INFO finish the various groups we're going to implement

* Mina - wrapper around minalib

* Exec - using Mina (or minalib, but hopefully mina)
