-- TODO InProgress
Reworking the entire IO stack
Redo all the node and subclasses tests, many of which are commented out
For FSTDevice, what to do when we try to read with _writeFlag or _writeMarkFlag set?

-- TODO BUGS
ByteChannelModule unit tests - they wait without being notify()able, which slows down IO tests
SLJ instruction - U < 0200 is GRS, U+1 is always storage (we don't do that)
We've broken breakpoint on fetch due to not developing absolute addresses anymore.
  Consider abandoning breakpoints...
Jumps to indirect addresses (in BM) - does the return address reflect the original jump-from,
  or does it wrongly reflect the indirected-to location?
  Applies to all jumps, as well as to LxJ
Check BDI$ function in minalib - do we need it, is it right?


-- TODO implement
* hardwarelib
Use AbsoluteAddress.populate() everywhere it makes sense so we can reconfigure the layout if/when necessary
SystemProcessor: For starting/monitoring/stopping system, and for console communication
  Move dayclock architecture to SystemProcessor
RAMDiskDevice word interface, optional dedupe with SHA-256, required backing store
RAMTapeDevice byte interface, optional compression, optional backing store

CardReaderDevice

Catch throwables, and turn them into hardware fault machine interrupts
Change extended mode dbanks to start at lower-limit 0 - this *should* work...
For basic mode, no need really to test the bank limits on every fetch - set it once, then save it and use it...
  what to do when we run off the end of the bank?
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)

* minalib
Implement LBDI$ in Linker and Assembler, and maybe other such things
unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
need to put partial-words into the dictionary - and should we allow these as expressions in j-field?
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff
pick up the rest of the unit tests we need to do but haven't yet
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
float values - firm this up (how do we support it)
data generation - floats
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
make sure we don't propagate flagged attribute in any of the operators
support user-defined functions
allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)
