TODO InProgress

Kute
    Bug: Trace Viewer needs to be a standalone application
    Console test app - should detect size and accommodate
    Console test app - should detect whether color is supported via placing FCC and forcing XMIT.
    Console test app - need to finish this up
        Set up pseudo-random read-only and read-reply messages
    Blinking Start (ASCII_FS) and Blinking End (ASCII_GS) characters need to be implemented in trace viewer
    Tab forward is maybe broken
    Tab backward
    Lots of other basic stuff which is currently TODO in the code
        (but not transfer)
    Implement Print - configure up to 9 print destinations P1-P9 (files, actual print queues, local printers...?)
    Backspace
    msg-waiting indicator should produce a beep at 1Hz until acknowledged
    File menu
        Reset
        Trace Start
        Trace Pause
        Trace Stop
    Other Applications for testing Kute
        Demand Simulator
            login with username/password
            @@RLU, @@RLD
            @@TERM
            @@X which cancels long lists
            message-wait to pause lists
            accepts msg-waiting which we have to acknowledge manually
        TIP Simulator (maybe a simple KEdit?)
        Yahtzee (just for fun?)
        Qubic (just for fun?)
    Indicator for FCC enabled/disabled
    Settings need to be adjusted a bit:
        rows, columns
        send, accept expanded FCC (as opposed to basic)
        enable/disable color mode (implied sending color FCC if appropriate, accepts color FCC)
        enable/disable emphasis mode
        font family, size
        host name, port number
        enter is xmit
        escape is msg-wait
    Load/Save templates from the settings page
    File open selects a template which then opens a new terminal and connects
    When we scan cursor backward into protected field, it moves back to the next unprotected field...
        should it move backward to the previous unprotected field?

Networking
    Need to think about this some more

ReaderSymbiontInfo
    @FILE and @ENDF handling (do we really need or want this?)
PunchSymbiontInfo
    Lots to do still, mostly dealing with SM keyin and related stuff
PrinterSymbiontInfo
    Lots to do still, mostly dealing with SM keyin and related stuff
    If the queued file is a tape file, we have to assign it and read from it

CSI
    Several statements still to be done

Batch Runs
    Coarse Scheduler
    BL keyin
    CS keyin

Hardware
    IP Engine (library component which can also be rolled into a hardware emulator)
    Tape Device, Channel, Library
    Image Punch
    Printer

GENF$
    Output queue record
    Recover on normal boot

Facilities
    Wait on resources
    Lots of specific things
    DN keyin not finished
    UP keyin not finished
    SU keyin not finished?
    RV keyin not finished

TODO BUGS

--------------------
TODO To be implemented

ALL
    Just use Log4J for logging

Kute
    Transfer - configure up to 9 virtual disks D1-D9 (files)
    special raster font which uses our own character specification (requires reworking display panes)
    Once the font selection is supported, we *could* support downloadable fonts
    enable/disable graphics - this is a major undertaking, and we must support color disabled option
        See Chapter 5 of UTS 30 Single Station System Reference

Kons (A GUI console)

Maybe a GUI version of kexec?

RSI remote devices
    printers using LP protocol
    punches using TCP protocol(?)
    readers using TCP protocol(?)

Accounts

User-ids

Symbionts
    Recover backlog from GENF$ on boot
    Recover print/punch queues from GENF$ on boot

Recovery Boot

Demand Runs

TIP Runs

Hardware
    IP - do we let the admin define a certain number of IPs we round-robin amongst Legacy Task activities?
        or do we create one of these per activity?

Removable Disk

Tape Handling

Exec Requests

Nexes
    NURPUR
    NLIST

-- OLD STUFF - only here for reference, if needed --
-- TODO BUGS
* baselib
See InstructionWord BTHandler interpreting B16..B31

* kasm
Code display needs to display generated code according to attached form (if any)
Code display needs to display $EQU and $EQUF values
I$ and EI$ forms - should h and i fields be one field? How does that affect mnemonic generation?
String concatenation does not honor precision per MASM 5.3.1
Locale columns are wrongly all over the place for parsed expressions
  Need to add some unit testing to cover this
See 5.6 - label on a $LIT directive should create a function

* klink
integrateValue() is maybe wrong. See IntegerValue for proper code.

* klink/kasm
Coding LBDIREF$+tag creates a relocated word with a base value of tag's offset from it's LC pool
  When klink resolves it, it adds the BDI to the base value instead of just overlaying it.
  What should we do about this?
    Maybe... klink should, in this case, clear out the field-descriptor described by the reference
    before integrating the BDI value...

* hwlib
ByteChannelModule unit tests - they wait without being notify()able, which slows down IO tests
Check to ensure breakpoints are all working.
UR instruction, bank manipulation, see TODO - need to account for UR to basic mode

everywhere:
    Max real bank size is 0_077777_777777 (with large bit set), which requires a long.
    We have code all over the place which uses an int for bank size, bank addresses, etc.

-- TODO Thoughts
Do we need a high-level language for systems programming to supplement assembly?
It appears that collector-generated absolute elements must always start in Basic mode. ?
"For absolutes that are executed as programs, the Exec loads all banks produced by the Collector at level 2."



-- TODO implement
*html/css/javascript
IPL page
  System status(?)
  Maybe an indication of the number of sessions connected?
  Boot source (binary selection of tape boot, disk boot, other binary boot)
  Path and volume selection for tape and disk boots
Hardware page
  Node configuration, basically
  Move Dump Config button here from the IPL page
  Add button to dump memory contents (optionally with analysis?)
System page
  All the non-hardware related configurables
    Give SPIF the ability to control logging levels
        The following, in Node.java, should be subject to management by SPIF / SoftwareConfiguration

SP: Move dayclock architecture to SystemProcessor
IP: SYSC subfunctions need unit tests
Redo all the node and subclasses tests, many of which are commented out (Node has been done)
Need some unit tests of proper DR settings across interrupts, returns, and UR instruction
IP: SYSC subfunctions for IO
IP: need more address space management instructions unit tests
IP: basic mode procedure call unit tests for LBJ, LIJ, LDJ for basic and extended mode banks
IP: extended mode procedure call unit tests for GOTO, CALL to basic mode

  LRD, SMD, RMD, LMC, SDMN, SDMS, SDMF, RDC
Change unit test extended mode dbanks to start at lower-limit 0 - this *should* work...
For basic mode, no need really to test the bank limits on every fetch - set it once, then save it and use it...
  what to do when we run off the end of the bank?
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)

* kasm
Need to support "$(n)" as a relocated reference to location counter n offset by 0 (for expressions)
  Can we implement this as a built-in function?
Do we emit diagnostics at the point where 'S' post-fix operator is applied to a value larger than 36 bits? Or only when we generate code?
more FloatingPointValue unit tests
more unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
unit tests for more built-in functions - we're missing a lot of them
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff.. now I forgot what this means
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
support user-defined functions
create object modules directly (has some implications with how kasm generates code)
functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1

    update: It's stored in a sort of JSON format
    update: It's an array of BankDescriptors (stored in JSON format)
