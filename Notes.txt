-- TODO BUGS
BaseFunctions - need to make data banks extended mode
SLJ instruction - U < 0200 is GRS, U+1 is always storage (we don't do that)
We've broken breakpoint on fetch due to not developing absolute addresses anymore.
BankDescriptor seems to take a very long time to create from storage... why?
Test code loads successive 512 word banks at 1024 word offsets - is this right?

-- TODO implement
* baselib
some new instructions

* hardwarelib
Change extended mode dbanks to start at lower-limit 0 - this *should* work...
For basic mode, no need really to test the bank limits on every fetch - set it once, then save it and use it...
  what to do when we run off the end of the bank?
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)
IP,IOP: UPI send/ack mechanism for IOs

MSP: add support for banks dynamically allocated from native system
IP: IPC instruction for dynamic bank allocation
IP: interrupt processing, use standard bank switching logic
IP: IPC instruction for console communication

IOP: rework IOP, CHMOD, and downstream - lose CU's maybe
Rewrite disk (and maybe tape) devices using async IO
All Device objects: add Builder class, make constructors private

* minalib
unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
need to put partial-words into the dictionary - and should we allow these as expressions in j-field?
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff
pick up the rest of the unit tests we need to do but haven't yet
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
float values - firm this up (how do we support it)
data generation - floats
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
make sure we don't propagate flagged attribute in any of the operators
support user-defined functions
allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)
