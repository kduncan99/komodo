-- TODO InProgress
* hardwarelib
Can some of the primitive POJOs which relate to the IP only, become nested classes thereof?
Support $EQUF - need to review all of Appendix A of MASM ref, then work on mnemonic generation
Do we emit diagnostics at the point where 'S' post-fix operator is applied to a value larger than 36 bits? Or only when we generate code?


-- TODO BUGS
* hardwarelib
ByteChannelModule unit tests - they wait without being notify()able, which slows down IO tests
We've broken breakpoint on fetch due to not developing absolute addresses anymore.
  Actually, we *do* develop abs address on get/store operands... leverage that.
  Also, BreakpointRegister is broken

* minalib
Assembler isn't returning null module when errors are detected... why?
    Do all T diagnostics result in a rel module not being generated?
((077) + 5) does not generate a literal 077 as it should do
String concatenation does not honor precision per MASM 5.3.1
assembler needs to be smart enough to do the right thing with B16-B31 (move msbit to .i field)


-- TODO Thoughts


-- TODO implement
* baselib
more FloatingPointComponent tests

* hardwarelib
Redo all the node and subclasses tests, many of which are commented out
For FSTDevice, what to do when we try to read with _writeFlag or _writeMarkFlag set?
SystemProcessor: For starting/monitoring/stopping system, and for console communication
  Move dayclock architecture to SystemProcessor
Need some unit tests of proper DR settings across interrupts, returns, and UR instruction
RAMDiskDevice word interface, optional dedupe with SHA-256, required backing store
RAMTapeDevice byte interface, optional compression, optional backing store
PrinterDevice
CardReaderDevice

IP: SYSC subfunctions for console communication

Change unit test extended mode dbanks to start at lower-limit 0 - this *should* work...
For basic mode, no need really to test the bank limits on every fetch - set it once, then save it and use it...
  what to do when we run off the end of the bank?
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)

* minalib
We really need to support identifiers > 12 characters
more FloatingPointValue unit tests
more unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
unit tests for more built-in functions - we're missing a lot of them
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
need to put partial-words into the dictionary - and should we allow these as expressions in j-field?
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff.. now I forgot what this means
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
add test cases for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
support user-defined functions
allow expression list inside literal which is part of expression e.g., ((005, 007) + 12)
functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1
  $LCB
  $LCFV
  $LCN
  $SSS
  $LCV
  $NODE (an empty node - this is maybe a built-in value, not a function?)

  $BASE (maybe)
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF

  $INCLUDE (what does this mean for us?)
  $INFO finish the various groups we're going to implement
