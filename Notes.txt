-- TODO InProgress
hwlib:
    InstructionProcessor SYSC console stuff is mostly broken due to code mistakes
    SystemProcessor: loadBinary() Completely rework this
    Test_SystemProcessor: absolute_load test - improve how this works
    Test_Linker: need to fix unit tests

exlib:
    external file formats for hosting SDFF and PF files (and maybe tape files?)
    support sym, rel, and abs elements
    support various tape file formats


-- TODO BUGS
ByteChannelModule unit tests - they wait without being notify()able, which slows down IO tests
Check to ensure breakpoints are all working.

* kasm
See Test_Diagnostics.formOK - we are getting a T we should not get.
See other unit test failures - these are regressions.
String concatenation does not honor precision per MASM 5.3.1
Locale columns are wrongly all over the place for parsed expressions
  Need to add some unit testing to cover this


-- TODO Thoughts
Do we need a high-level language for systems programming to supplement assembly?
It appears that collector-generated absolute elements must always start in Basic mode. ?
"For absolutes that are executed as programs, the Exec loads all banks produced by the Collector at level 2."



-- TODO implement
*html/css/javascript
IPL page
  System status(?)
  Maybe an indication of the number of sessions connected?
  Boot source (binary selection of tape boot, disk boot, other binary boot)
  Path and volume selection for tape and disk boots
Hardware page
  Node configuration, basically
  Move Dump Config button here from the IPL page
  Add button to dump memory contents (optionally with analysis?)
System page
  All the non-hardware related configurables
    Give SPIF the ability to control logging levels
        The following, in Node.java, should be subject to management by SPIF / SoftwareConfiguration
            static final boolean LOG_CHANNEL_IOS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_CHANNEL_IO_BUFFERS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_DEVICE_IOS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_DEVICE_IO_BUFFERS = true;
            static final boolean LOG_IO_ERRORS = true;
OS Configuration page (new page)
  KEXEC configuration items

Set logger name to foo.class.getSimpleName()

SP: Move dayclock architecture to SystemProcessor
IP: SYSC subfunctions need unit tests
CM: ChannelModules should log based on LOG_CHANNEL_IOS and LOG_CHANNEL_IO_BUFFERS (or the config equivalent)
Need a SystemLogTapeDevice
Redo all the node and subclasses tests, many of which are commented out (Node has been done)
For FSTDevice, what to do when we try to read with _writeFlag or _writeMarkFlag set?
Need some unit tests of proper DR settings across interrupts, returns, and UR instruction
RAMDiskDevice word interface, optional dedupe with SHA-256, required backing store
RAMTapeDevice byte interface, optional compression, optional backing store
PrinterDevice
CardReaderDevice
CardPunchDevice
IP: SYSC subfunctions for IO
IP: need more address space management instructions unit tests
IP: basic mode procedure call unit tests for LBJ, LIJ, LDJ for basic and extended mode banks
IP: extended mode procedure call unit tests for GOTO, CALL to basic mode
IP: unit tests for interrupts (many of them already marked TODO)
IP: unit tests
  LIJ, LBJ, LDJ
  LD, SD, LPD, SPD, LUD, SUD, LAE, UR, ACEL, DCEL, SKQT, KCHG
  LRD, SMD, RMD, LMC, SDMN, SDMS, SDMF, RDC
Change unit test extended mode dbanks to start at lower-limit 0 - this *should* work...
For basic mode, no need really to test the bank limits on every fetch - set it once, then save it and use it...
  what to do when we run off the end of the bank?
need some conditional jump tests which would incur reference violation if they jumped
    both jumping (ref violation) and not jumping (no ref violation)

* kasm
Support $EQUF - need to review all of Appendix A of MASM ref, then work on mnemonic generation
Need to support "$(n)" as a relocated reference to location counter n offset by 0 (for expressions)
  Can we implement this as a built-in function?
Do we emit diagnostics at the point where 'S' post-fix operator is applied to a value larger than 36 bits? Or only when we generate code?
more FloatingPointValue unit tests
more unit tests for string value generation
unit tests for node references - need to check results
unit tests for more built-in functions - we're missing a lot of them
support special form for JGD instruction
support special form for BT instruction
support node references on LHS of $EQU statements
need to put partial-words into the dictionary - and should we allow these as expressions in j-field?
remove UndefinedReferenceDiagnostic (I think...)
use DiagnosticDirective for stuff.. now I forgot what this means
do we need microstrings?
$USE (A.2.8) specifies base register to use if none given
can we do implicit base register (and do it right)?  also with the $LIT directive...
support user-defined functions
create object modules directly (has some implications with how kasm generates code)
functions
  $ILCN
  $L0
  $L1
  $LCB
  $LCFV
  $LCN
  $SSS
  $LCV
  $NODE (an empty node - this is maybe a built-in value, not a function?)
directives
  $FUNC (user-defined functions)
  $USE (implicit base register)
  $INSERT (maybe)
  $BASE (maybe)
  $IF / $ELSE / $ELSF / $ENDF
  $DO / $ENDD
  $REPEAT / $ENDR
  $GEN
  $INCLUDE (what does this mean for us?)
  $INFO finish the various groups we're going to implement

* klink
  Create absolute modules
  Create object modules
  Define what a saved binary looks like
    update: It's stored in a sort of JSON format
    update: It's an array of BankDescriptors (stored in JSON format)
